PHASE 3: FINE-TUNING & MONITORING COMPLETE
=========================================

🚀 PHASE 3 IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:
✅ Successfully implemented comprehensive fine-tuning and monitoring enhancements
✅ Optimized TTL values based on performance analysis
✅ Added real-time performance monitoring with alerting
✅ Enhanced cache preloading for common games
✅ Created performance dashboard and API endpoints
✅ Integrated monitoring into main server

WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED:

1. TTL OPTIMIZATION:
   ✅ User Profile: 300s → 600s (10 minutes) - stable data
   ✅ Game Data: 1800s → 3600s (1 hour) - very stable data  
   ✅ Game Sessions: 30s → 60s (1 minute) - balance freshness/performance
   ✅ Wallet Data: 10s → 30s (30 seconds) - more aggressive caching
   ✅ Provider Config: 3600s → 7200s (2 hours) - configuration data

2. REAL-TIME PERFORMANCE MONITORING:
   ✅ Automatic monitoring every 60 seconds
   ✅ Performance threshold alerting:
      - Cache hit rate < 70% → Warning
      - Avg response time > 5ms → Warning  
      - Connection errors > 10 → Critical alert
   ✅ Performance summary logging every 5 minutes
   ✅ Comprehensive metrics tracking

3. ENHANCED CACHE PRELOADING:
   ✅ preloadUserData() - batch loads user profile + wallet + common games
   ✅ batchWarmCache() - efficient batch operations
   ✅ Common games preloading: BassBoss, AztecTreasure, CashBandits, etc.
   ✅ Integrated into RTG cached service for predictive loading

4. PERFORMANCE MONITORING SERVICE:
   ✅ Comprehensive system health monitoring
   ✅ Performance history tracking (last 100 measurements)
   ✅ Memory usage monitoring with alerts (>500MB warning)
   ✅ Performance status classification (EXCELLENT/GOOD/FAIR/NEEDS_ATTENTION)
