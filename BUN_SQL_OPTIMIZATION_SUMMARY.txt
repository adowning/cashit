BUN.SQL RTG SPIN OPTIMIZATION - PHASE 1 COMPLETE (REFACTORED)
===============================================================

IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:
âœ… Successfully implemented Bun.sql native PostgreSQL optimization
âœ… Replaced Prisma ORM with direct Bun.sql queries for hot paths
âœ… Created atomic transaction block using sql.begin()
âœ… Added comprehensive performance logging for comparison
âœ… REFACTORED: Updated all queries to match current Prisma schema
âœ… REFACTORED: Fixed all field names to use snake_case database mapping
âœ… REFACTORED: Corrected Bun.sql syntax (removed sql.unsafe usage)

WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED:

1. NEW OPTIMIZED SERVICE (rtg-optimized.service.ts):
   - Uses Bun's native `sql` import for PostgreSQL
   - Implements all 5 hottest queries with Bun.sql
   - Single atomic transaction block using sql.begin()
   - Automatic prepared statements and connection pooling

2. OPTIMIZED QUERIES IMPLEMENTED:
   âœ… User Profile + VIP Query (HOTTEST #1)
   âœ… Platform Game Query  
   âœ… Active Game Session Query
   âœ… Wallet UPSERT Query (HOTTEST #4)
   âœ… Complete Transaction Block (HOTTEST #2)

3. BUN.SQL FEATURES UTILIZED:
   - Native PostgreSQL wire protocol
   - Automatic prepared statements
   - Built-in connection pooling
   - Template literal syntax with ${} parameters
   - sql.begin() for atomic transactions
   - Automatic parameter sanitization

4. TRANSACTION OPTIMIZATION:
   - Single atomic transaction using sql.begin()
   - All operations within one transaction context
   - Reduced database round trips
   - Atomic wallet balance updates
   - Proper rollback on errors

5. ROUTES CONFIGURED:
   - /rtg/games/rtg/platform/:id/:token/game/spin (OPTIMIZED - Bun.sql)
   - /rtg/games/rtg/platform/:id/:token/game/spin-perf (Performance measurement)
   - /rtg/games/rtg/platform/:id/:token/game/spin-original (Original Prisma)

EXPECTED PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:

Based on Bun.sql documentation and our baseline metrics:

BASELINE (Prisma):
- Total Execution Time: ~3,800ms
- Main Transaction: ~1,500ms (40%)
- Individual Queries: ~200ms each

EXPECTED WITH BUN.SQL:
- Total Execution Time: ~400-600ms (85% improvement)
- Main Transaction: ~100-200ms (90% improvement)  
- Individual Queries: ~10-30ms each (90% improvement)

BUN.SQL PERFORMANCE ADVANTAGES:
1. Direct PostgreSQL wire protocol (no ORM overhead)
2. Native prepared statements (automatic)
3. Optimized connection pooling
4. Reduced memory allocation
5. Faster query parsing and execution
6. Lower CPU usage

OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES APPLIED:
âœ… Eliminated Prisma ORM overhead
âœ… Reduced object creation and transformation
âœ… Single atomic transaction block
âœ… Direct SQL with parameter binding
âœ… Automatic query preparation and caching
âœ… Native connection management

TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:

1. BASELINE COMPARISON:
   - Use /spin-original for Prisma baseline
   - Use /spin-perf for detailed measurements
   - Use /spin for optimized Bun.sql version

2. PERFORMANCE MONITORING:
   - Check console for real-time progress indicators
   - Review performance logs in performance-logs/ directory
   - Compare timing between versions

3. EXPECTED CONSOLE OUTPUT:
   ðŸš€ [1/6] Starting optimized user profile query...
   âœ… User profile query completed in 15.23ms
   ðŸš€ [2/6] Starting optimized game query...
   âœ… Game query completed in 8.45ms
   ... and so on

NEXT STEPS (Phase 2):
1. Test the Bun.sql optimization
2. Measure actual performance gains
3. Implement Redis caching layer
4. Optimize jackpot processing (Phase 2)
5. Add tournament processing optimization

REFACTORING CHANGES MADE:

1. SCHEMA ALIGNMENT (CORRECTED):
   - Table names: snake_case mapping (user_profiles, vip_infos, game_sessions, etc.)
   - Field names: camelCase in queries with quotes ("operatorId", "userId", "gameId", etc.)
   - VIP relationship: user_profiles."vipInfoId" â†’ vip_infos.id
   - Transaction fields: "userProfileId", "walletId", "providerTxId", "relatedGameId", etc.
   - Game session fields: "gameSessionId", "totalWagered", "totalWon", "isActive"
   - Game spin fields: "gameSessionId", "wagerAmount", "grossWinAmount", "currencyId"
   - Wallet fields: "userId", "operatorId", "bonusBalance", "lockedBalance", "paymentMethod"

2. BUN.SQL SYNTAX CORRECTIONS:
   - Removed incorrect sql.unsafe() usage
   - Used proper template literal syntax: sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${param}`
   - Fixed transaction syntax: sql.begin(async (tx) => { await tx`...` })
   - Corrected parameter binding throughout all queries

3. PERFORMANCE LOGGING INTEGRATION:
   - Added comprehensive timing for each operation
   - Real-time console progress indicators
   - Detailed performance comparison metrics
   - Error logging with performance context

TECHNICAL DETAILS:

FINAL CORRECTED BUN.SQL SYNTAX:
```typescript
// Template literal with parameter binding (SCHEMA-ACCURATE)
const [user] = await sql`
  SELECT u.id, u.username, u.balance, u."operatorId", u.role,
         v.level, v."currentLevelXp", v."totalXp", v."cashbackPercentage"
  FROM user_profiles u
  LEFT JOIN vip_infos v ON u."vipInfoId" = v.id
  WHERE u.id = ${userId}
`

// Atomic transaction (SCHEMA-ACCURATE)
return await sql.begin(async (tx) => {
  const [wallet] = await tx`SELECT balance FROM wallets WHERE id = ${walletId}`
  const [betTx] = await tx`
    INSERT INTO transactions ("userProfileId", "operatorId", "walletId", type, status, amount,
                             "balanceBefore", "balanceAfter", description, provider, "providerTxId",
                             "relatedGameId", "relatedRoundId", "createdAt")
    VALUES (${userId}, ${operatorId}, ${walletId}, ${TransactionType.BET}, ${TransactionStatus.COMPLETED},
            ${-wagerAmountCents}, ${balanceBeforeCents}, ${balanceBeforeCents - wagerAmountCents},
            ${'Bet on RTG'}, ${'RTG'}, ${'bet-' + providerRoundId},
            ${gameId}, ${providerRoundId}, NOW())
    RETURNING id
  `

  // Game session update with correct field names
  const [updatedSession] = await tx`
    UPDATE game_sessions
    SET "totalWagered" = "totalWagered" + ${wagerAmountCents},
        "totalWon" = "totalWon" + ${winAmountCents},
        "updatedAt" = NOW()
    WHERE id = ${gameSessionId}
    RETURNING *
  `

  // Game spin creation with correct field names
  const [gameSpin] = await tx`
    INSERT INTO game_spins ("gameSessionId", "wagerAmount", "grossWinAmount", "currencyId",
                           "spinData", "timeStamp", "sessionId")
    VALUES (${gameSessionId}, ${wagerAmountCents}, ${winAmountCents}, ${'USD'},
            ${JSON.stringify({ providerRoundId, rgsRawResponse })}, NOW(), ${providerSessionId})
    RETURNING id
  `

  return result
})
```
