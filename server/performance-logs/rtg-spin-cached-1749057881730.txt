Timestamp: 2025-06-04T17:24:41.730Z
User ID: lhL30ZMSSK9r1lzpyjjJ4vyJtqxarBZj
Game ID: BassBossRTG
Success: true
CacheDatabase Used: DragonflyDB


JACKPOT PROCESSING (Phase 4.5 - Asynchronous):
- Processing Mode: Asynchronous (Non-blocking)
- Jackpot Contributions: Processing asynchronously
- Total Contribution: Processing asynchronously
- Jackpot Win: Processing asynchronously
- Performance Impact: Zero (jackpot processing doesn't block spin response)


CACHED PERFORMANCE METRICS (Bun.sql + Redis):
- Total Execution Time: 701.03ms
- User Profile Query (Cached): 1.26ms
- Game Query (Cached): 96.12ms
- Session Query (Cached): 100.49ms
- Wallet Query (Cached): 96.12ms
- RGS Call Time: 0.06ms
- Cached Transaction (Bun.sql): 501.50ms

CACHE PERFORMANCE (Metrics from CacheService):
- Cache Hit Rate: 71.43%
- Cache Hits: 60
- Cache Misses: 24
- Cache Avg Response Time: 2.02ms
- Cache Errors: 0

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT vs BASELINE:
- Target: <300ms total execution time
- Previous Baseline: ~3800ms average (example value)
- Previous Optimized: ~580ms average (example value)
- Current Cached: 701.03ms
- Improvement vs Baseline: 81.55% (example calculation)
- Improvement vs Optimized: -20.87% (example calculation)

CACHED PERFORMANCE BREAKDOWN:
- Database Operations (incl. transaction): 113.47%
- RGS Call: 0.01%
- Cache Operations (estimated): 0.00%

OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES APPLIED:
✅ Bun.sql native PostgreSQL driver
✅ DragonflyDB caching layer (via cacheService)
✅ Single atomic transaction block
✅ Intelligent cache invalidation
✅ Asynchronous Cache warming capabilities (via cacheService.warmCache)
✅ Performance metrics tracking
✅ Retry mechanism for transient "prepared statement" DB errors
✅ Phase 4.5: Asynchronous jackpot processing (non-blocking)
✅ Parallelized initial data fetches
✅ Asynchronous performance logging
