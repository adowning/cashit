OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES APPLIED:
✅ Bun.sql native PostgreSQL driver
✅ DragonflyDB caching layer (via cacheService)
✅ Single atomic transaction block
✅ Intelligent cache invalidation
✅ Asynchronous Cache warming capabilities (via cacheService.warmCache)
✅ Performance metrics tracking
✅ Retry mechanism for transient "prepared statement" DB errors
✅ Phase 4.5: Asynchronous jackpot processing (non-blocking)
✅ Parallelized initial data fetches
✅ Asynchronous performance logging
