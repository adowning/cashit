RTG SPIN PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT SETUP
=====================================

WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED:
- Created rtg-performance.service.ts with comprehensive performance logging
- Added detailed timing measurements for all database operations
- Instrumented the top 5 hottest queries identified:
  1. User Profile + VIP Query
  2. Main Transaction Block  
  3. Jackpot Processing
  4. Tournament Processing
  5. Wallet Check Query

ROUTES AVAILABLE:
- /rtg/games/rtg/platform/:id/:token/game/spin (NEW - with performance metrics)
- /rtg/games/rtg/platform/:id/:token/game/spin-original (original version for comparison)

PERFORMANCE LOGS LOCATION:
- All performance data will be saved to: performance-logs/rtg-spin-{timestamp}.txt
- Each spin creates a detailed log with timing breakdowns

TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Start your server
2. Make RTG spin requests to the main endpoint
3. Performance logs will be automatically generated
4. Review the logs to see timing breakdowns

WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN LOGS:
- Total Execution Time
- Individual query times
- Database call count
- Performance breakdown percentages
- Top 5 hottest queries timing

SAMPLE LOG OUTPUT:
=== RTG SPIN PERFORMANCE LOG ===
Timestamp: 2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z
User ID: user123
Game ID: game456
Success: true

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
- Total Execution Time: 1250.45ms
- User Profile Query: 45.23ms
- Platform Game Query: 23.12ms
- Active Game Session Query: 34.56ms
- Wallet Check Query: 67.89ms
- RGS Call Time: 234.56ms
- Main Transaction Time: 456.78ms
- Jackpot Processing Time: 234.12ms
- Tournament Processing Time: 123.45ms

DATABASE METRICS:
- Total DB Calls: 15
- Average DB Call Time: 83.36ms

PERFORMANCE BREAKDOWN:
- Initial DB Queries: 13.6%
- RGS Call: 18.8%
- Main Transaction: 36.5%
- Jackpot Processing: 18.7%
- Tournament Processing: 9.9%

TOP 5 HOTTEST QUERIES IDENTIFIED:
1. User Profile + VIP Query: 45.23ms
2. Main Transaction Block: 456.78ms  
3. Jackpot Processing: 234.12ms
4. Tournament Processing: 123.45ms
5. Wallet Check Query: 67.89ms

OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Cache user profiles with VIP info (TTL: 5 minutes)
- Cache wallet data with optimistic locking (TTL: 30 seconds)
- Cache active jackpots state (TTL: 10 seconds)
- Cache active tournaments (TTL: 1 minute)
- Batch jackpot contribution inserts
- Use Bun.sql for hot path queries

NEXT STEPS AFTER TESTING:
1. Run multiple spins to collect baseline metrics
2. Analyze the performance logs to identify bottlenecks
3. Report back with the timing data
4. I will then implement Bun.sql + Redis optimizations for the top 5 hottest queries

CONSOLE OUTPUT:
You'll also see real-time progress in the console:
üîç [1/8] Starting user profile + VIP query...
‚úÖ User profile query completed in 45.23ms
üîç [2/8] Starting provider config query...
‚úÖ Provider config query completed in 23.12ms
... and so on

The performance measurement system is now ready for testing!
